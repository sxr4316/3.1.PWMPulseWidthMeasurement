Project One : PWM Pulse Width Measurement
A standalone program based on the Freescale HCS12D / MC9S12DT256 platform to monitor a PWM signal source,
and report the distribution of measured periods of a 1000 samples. Interrupts trigger capture of system time
which is used to evaluate the time between two events (signal rising edges).
